# SimpleSound
The java SimpleSound API has a very simple purpose: to make audio recording and playback more accessible to beginner and intermediate java programmers. If you have looked at the javax.sound API it is a pretty advanced library and might be hard for those just starting to learn java. What SimpleSound does is it breaks the javax.sound API into two fundemental parts: recording and playback. SimpleRecorder is an object that allows users to initialize a filename [String] with a SimpleRecorder object and then they simply call the .record() method. Or for playback they initialize a filename [String] with a SimplePlayback object and call the .play() method.
